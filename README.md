# My-Simple-ATM-Project
This is my first project ever uploaded to GitHub! 
Under the tutelage of Internet videos, and some college courses, I built a simple little C++ ATM project! Enjoy!
I took heavy inspiration from CodeBeauty on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wccZgjs90S8

This code allows users to interact with a hypothetical banking system. 
It allows users to manually enter an integer option to navigate the menu and select an option.
It also lets users enter the balance of their account to further interact with the system.
Messages will print out depending on the nature of your choice.

The code was written using elementary concepts in the C++ language. 
While I was experimenting with this project, I was early in my career of programming, and struggled to write functions.
Now, they're a piece of cake. I love making things that people can interact and have fun with. 
I still try to implement elements of my markup language background whenever I can, so I tried to make the menu more attractive. 

This project can be run with nearly any programming application such as Visual Studio, XCode, or even online C++ compilers. 

If you encounter any issues, feel free to contact me. Thank you for reading!
